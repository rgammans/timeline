Timeline
========


A JS /HTML5 timeline editing visualisation tool.

Dependencies
------------

Uses the babel compiler (npm install -g babel ) 
Builds are managed with make.
Dependies are managed with Bower..


Getting Started
---------------
make sure you have a node environment with bower and babel.

To do this on a linux box I recommended running the following:-

virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install nodeenv
nodeenv -p  #Can take a long time
npm install -g babel
npm install -g bower


Then you should be able to run make
to build this project with the make utility , which you run with 
'make' . Make should be  come installed as standard linux and  Macs

All the deliverables are in html and lib at the moment.

A demo page of the built application is at my http://backslashat.org/timeline/html/timeline.html
