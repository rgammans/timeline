Timeline
========


A J S /HTML5 timeline editing visualisation tool.

Dependencies
------------

uses the babel compiler (npm install -g babel ) 
Builds make, and bower.


Getting Started.
---------------
make sure you have a node enviromnnet with bower and babel.

To do this on a linux box I recommended running the following:0

virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install nodeenv
nodeenv -p  #Can take a long time
npm install -g babel
npm install -g bower


Then you shoue be able to run make
to build this project.

Allthe deliverables are in html and lib at the moment.
